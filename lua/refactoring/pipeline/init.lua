---@class RefactorPipeline
---Allows for pipelining tasks.  Tasks are functions that are expected to
---return ok (boolean), value (thing to be returned or passed to next task)
---
---Async tasks are functions that will take the previous result and a function
---to call back when done with ok, and value
---@field _tasks table: list of tasks
---@field _after RefactorPipeline: A single pipeline to run next afterwords
local Pipeline = {}
Pipeline.__index = Pipeline

---@param task fun(seed: any?): boolean, any
---@return RefactorPipeline
function Pipeline:from_task(task)
    return setmetatable({

--- The primary purpose of this is to make post actions easy.
---
--- Imagine every refactor will have the following lines.
---
--- ```lua
--- :add_task(apply_text_edits)
--- :add_task(save)
--- :add_task(format)
--- :add_task(save)
--- ```
---
--- It would only make sense to allow for this pipeline to be attached
---

function Pipeline:after(pipeline)
